SpawnPlus
============

SpawnPlus is a spawn protection (and more) plugin for MCServer. It is designed to complement the in-built spawn protection in Core, and improve upon it. As such, it requires Core to be installed (why would you not have Coreâ€½), and it uses the spawn radius that is set in Core.

Installation
------------

Simply clone the repo into your Plugins folder and enable SpawnPlus as a plugin in your settings.ini.

Alternatively, you may download the [latest zip](http://ci.berboe.co.uk:/job/SpawnPlus/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/SpawnPlus.zip) and extract it into your Plugins folder.

Features

 * Notify people when they move into and out of spawn.
